# Task_1
The comprehensive cleaning and preparation of the **8807-row Netflix dataset** involved a multi-step process in Excel 2007, primarily focused on handling missing values and standardizing formats for analysis. Key actions included filling all major missing entries in `director`, `cast`, and `country` with the placeholder **`Not specified`**, converting the text-based `date_added` column to a proper Excel date format, and splitting the mixed-format `duration` column into numerical (`duration_num`) and unit (`duration_unit`) helpers. Furthermore, **`TRIM()`** was applied across relevant text columns to remove whitespace, and a **`primary_genre`** column was extracted from `listed_in`, ensuring the final **`netflix_cleaned.xlsx`** file contains consistent, standardized, and analytically-ready data on its dedicated `cleaned` sheet.
